For this JS + HTML project, my team members and I have decided to create what we call a Top Pot Scouter Tool.<br/ >

We have agreed to prompt the end user for 3 pieces of information: Location Name, minimum traffic, and maximum traffic. Once the user clicks the Submit button the data being inputed will be calculated to notify the user with the expected number of donuts that can potentially be required. The number of donuts will be listed for the Hour, Day, Week, and Month. This way, the end user can determine how profitable this potential new location can be by the donut estimates.<br />

The projections will be stored at the bottom of the window using a h2 and paragraph tag.<br />
