      <h2>About This Tool</h2>
      <p>Looking to open a new Top Pot franchise in a new location? This simple program will estimate a projected number of donuts purchased by potential customers! All that will be required from you is the name of the location (City), estimated minimum traffic (potential customers) for that location, and an estimated maximum traffic for that location.</p>
      <p>We will use your information and we will then combine it with our data to provide you with a projected number of donuts purchased. Hopefully, this information will motivate you to contact us to learn what is required to begin a new franchise with us as well as learning the benefits for joining our Top Pot Family!.</p>
      <p>Let's get started! Please input the required information stated below to view your estimates.</p>
